## TODO

- add late game evaluation. (only very early game evaluation exists for now)
- change global namespaced functions to blueprint libraries (for example ESquare::Rank)
- ESquare::no_sq or ESquare::offboard should be unnecessary. investigate.
- refactor pieces[] as "piece_infos" and TPiece as "TPieceInfo"
